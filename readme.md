# goRAPL

A dead-simple, low-level API for accessing the Intel RAPL API.



This is a rather experimental library that's early on in it's life, so it isn't very useful yet! It has a lot of shortcomings, and a lot of things that needs to do, but can't. Most notably, it can only handle systems with one CPU socket. TODOs and progress is being tracked on the issues page.
